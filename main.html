	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>My motivation to become a software developer stems from a deep curiosity about how technology works and a strong desire to solve real-world problems through code. From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and the endless possibilities they offer. As I began learning programming, I realized that software development is not just about writing codeâ€”it's about creating tools that can impact lives, streamline processes, and bring ideas to life. I enjoy the constant learning involved in this field and the satisfaction of building something meaningful from scratch. Being a developer allows me to blend creativity with logic and contribute to a world increasingly driven by technology.</p>
